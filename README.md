## Todo-react-app

![](https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/todo-react-app/blob/master/readme-image.bmp)

Deployed todo-react-app here [Todo](https://plevakovitalii.github.io/todo-react-app/todo-react/).

Implemented functionality:

- search for elements;
- filtering by status (completed or not);
- removal of elements;
- mark important elements;
- adding elements.

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- npm gh-pages

All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/todo-react-app.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
